        <h1>Note 0B - Solving problems to learn</h1>
        
        <br />

        <p>Throughout my limited experience in the IT field, the moments in which I learned the most were when I had to solve complex problems or find solutions to bugs.</p>
        
        <p>Starting with a problem is the best way to develop knowledge and creativity. I find that having a complex problem to solve in a limited time is one of the most enriching intellectual exercises, especially in a professional context. You have to know how to manage your stress and not lose your nerve, even if the stakes are high. Sometimes the problem seems too hard to solve in so little time. This type of exercise develops resilience and perseverance in the face of problems.</p>
        
        <p>When you start by solving a problem related to IT, you learn a lot, because to solve it, you test different potential solutions until you find the right one. Of all the solutions we test, only a few will work. If we succeed in solving the problem using one of the tested solutions, that doesn't mean we've learned just one thing. All the solutions tested are now part of our body of knowledge. We've been able to extend our skills and our level of knowledge on the subject. This makes problem-solving methodology a magnificent tool for developing knowledge in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Training yourself to solve complex problems in IT helps you move forward more quickly, because you learn so much more. It's active learning through experience. The harder the problem, the richer the learning. However, you need to be aware that this requires resilience.</p>
        
        <p>Getting stuck on a problem for a long time takes a lot of courage not to let go. From my point of view, being able to resist the temptation to give up on a problem if it gives you a hard time is a very important quality.</p>

        <p>When you struggle with a complex problem over a long period of time, you come to question your own abilities. You feel useless and incompetent. You might tell yourself that it's not for you and that you don't have the brain to solve this kind of problem. However, if you persist and succeed in solving the problem, you feel the opposite. You feel confident and unbeatable. Moreover, the more complex and time-consuming the problem was, the greater the satisfaction we felt when solving it.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, starting with a complex problem to solve in computer science allows us to develop our body of knowledge and skills more quickly, while at the same time developing qualities of resilience and perseverance (qualities that I believe are essential to survive in any profession in computer science).</p>

        <p>I think that's why, as a beginner in IT, I decided to take up a job as an IT Support Technician, since I find that this job is fundamentally based on solving user problems. I spend my day monitoring incoming tickets and trying to solve them. Each ticket concerns an IT problem that a user is currently experiencing. Each ticket is more or less different and more or less difficult. Sometimes I can solve it right away, sometimes I can't. Whatever the case, I have to be able to find the solution to the problem, because the user who sent in the ticket is experiencing a real and serious problem that could prevent him from working properly, or preventing him from working at all.</p>

        <p>I find this job very instructive, as it enables me to work on concrete IT problems encountered by users. But outside my job, what can I do to develop my knowledge? What problems can I solve? How can I find that methodology of having an unknown problem pop up in front of you with the simple aim of solving it?</p>

        <p>I don't want to dive into a big development project or anything like that. Even though I know such a project would give me an incredible number of problems to solve. I'd simply like to start with a random IT problem and try to solve it. Once solved, the aim is to move on to a completely different kind of problem without thinking too much about looking for another problem. I would like to find a plateform full of IT challenges to solve.</p>

        <p>While searching the internet to see if such a solution existed, I came across platforms hosting "Capture the flag" challenges. That's when everything changed. But aren't these challenges designed to make you a hacker? Would that suit me? Do I want to become a hacker?</p>

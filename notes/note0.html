        <p>Hi, I'm LeternelDebutant (alias for "L'éternel débutant" in french which stands for "The Eternal Beginner"). I'm very curious about computers and IT in general. I'm by no means an expert in the field. I wouldn't even claim to be an amateur. I am, and probably always will be, an eternal beginner.</p>
        
        <p>Like a child discovering the world, I don't know much about it and I ask myself questions all the time. Simple, naive questions most of the time, but for me they're vital if I want to understand how things work.</p>
        
        <p>This collection of notes is a way for me to share this quest for knowledge. I'd like to understand and learn everything about computers. I thought it might be interesting to share my thoughts and learning experiences along this journey, from the point of view of a beginner discovering the subject.</p>
        
        <p>Why this? Why that ? Like a child eager to understand the world around him, I'm burning with the desire to learn more about the wonderful world of computing. Like an eternal beginner, I remain naive and ask myself simple questions. Like an eternal beginner, I remain a child eager to learn.</p>

        <p>But why am I so curious about this subject? Why am I obsessed with this field? Why is it my passion? I have no idea...</p>

        <p>In order to answer these questions, I've decided to give free rein to my curiosity and become even more obsessed with this field. I want to know the answers. That being said, it doesn't mean I'll stop being as passionate about this field once I've found my answers (if that were the case).</p>

        <p>I think I finally found the thing I like in life. Why not going hard on that ?</p>

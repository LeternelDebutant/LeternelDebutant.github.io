        <h1>Note 0C - Do I want to be a hacker ?</h1>
        
        <br />

        <p>As explained in my previous note (Note 0B), I've recently come across a variety of platforms offering a range of different cybersecurity challenges. These challenges are called CTFs (Capture the Flag). The aim is to find a character string (a flag) hidden inside a system, program, etc... Simply by finding it, you can prove that you've successfully hacked the system or whatever the flag was placed in. The great thing about this activity is that it's like solving puzzles.</p>
            
        <p>When I found out about this kind of challenge, I thought it was the best way to learn as much as possible about how systems and IT work in general. If I'm able to break a system or exploit a vulnerability in it. That means I know a lot about it. In any case, I thought that doing these challenges would be a good way for me to learn more about computing in general.</p>
            
        <p>So I tested a few platforms and challenges on my own to experiment and... Damn, these challenges are hard... and fun at the same time! I realized two things while doing these challenges: 1) I don't know anything about computers. 2) Cybersecurity is a great place to learn a lot about IT in general. Of course, the learning is focused on security, but that requires a deep understanding of how things work.</p>

        <p>As I continued to learn about CTFs, I realized just how competitive it really is. There is an international ranking for the best teams. Each CTF has its own level of difficulty, which influences the number of points you can earn in the overall ranking by participating in it, and so on... It's literally esport!</p>

        <p>As I'm by nature a competitive person, I thought it would be cool to take part in the various competitions available against other teams. Especially as compared to the challenges available continuously on platforms such as picoCTF, rootme, tryhackme, etc... the challenges in these competitions have no solutions on the internet for the duration of the competition. This removes any temptation to give up and look for the solution, since it's not public yet. Brilliant! Participating in these competitions guarantees to offer struggle and excitement! The learning potential is enormous!</p>

        <p>When I found out about CTF competitions. I said to myself that I absolutely had to take part. But to take part, I needed a team. I could create my own team and play on my own, but that's not as much fun as playing with other people.</p>
        
        <p>However, in my circle of contacts, not many people are crazy enough to give up most of their weekends, several times a month, to sit in front of a computer, tearing their hair out over computer problems which, for the most part, can't be solved for obvious reasons of lack of skill... (I'm speaking mainly for myself).</p>

        <p>But after a while, I found someone. I found someone as crazy as me. This person's nickname is sampite. Rarely have I seen a person with such resilience and perseverance when dealing with computer problems. sampite is a developer. I've seen him at work. Whatever bug he has to solve, it will be solved. I couldn't have wished for a better team-mate to start this journey and have fun on weekends in front of the computer.</p>
        
        <p>All right, then. There are now two of us. The word team now has more meaning than if I'd stayed on my own. Now we need a name. I wanted a name that meant absolutely nothing, so that the history of this team could be written by its members. Let nothing in the name influence the team's identity and vision. The Pink Balloon Eternal is the product of my imagination, influenced by the various images and ideas I had in my head at the time. Yes, the name and logo are influenced by my nickname and profile picture. But the comparison stops there. I want the meaning and evolution of this initiative to develop over time and with the different members who make up and will make up this collective.</p>

        <p>My aim with this team is to have fun and learn first and foremost by playing in CTF competitions. I want this team to be open to other people. sampite and myself are pure beginners at the moment. There are no technical prerequisites to join us. If you want to have fun with us and learn, our doors are wide open.</p>

        <p>Of course, we play to win too, but right now the priority is on learning, collaboration between team members and having fun. Our respective activities during the week are busy and stressful enough at times not to have a good time competing at the weekend, even if it means torturing our minds over CTF challenges. At least we torture our minds together and in good spirits.</p>

        <p>The Pink Balloon Eternal is a welcoming team of friendly people driven by their desire to learn and improve. Above all, it's a human adventure in computing. There's no commitment if you play with the team. Play with us if you want to. Whether it's just once, occasionally or all the time, it's up to you. Just be aware of one thing. We're beginners at most things. We don't really know what we're doing... but at least we're doing something.</p>
